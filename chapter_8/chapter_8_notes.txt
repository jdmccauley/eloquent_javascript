Eloquent Javascript 3rd Edition Notes

Chapter 8
Bugs and Errors

	• Flaws in programs are typically called 'bugs'
	• There's typically two types of bugs:
		○ Those that come from confused thoughts
		○ Those from an error putting the thought into code
	• The second is usually a simple fix, while the former takes re-thinking to fix

Language
	• JavaScript's weak typing system can be a huge source of bugs
	• Grammatical errors are typically pointed out as errors immediately upon compilation
	• Some computations that aren't valid result in a 'NaN' (not a number), and continue being used in the program until a major error is produced
		○ These are hard to find where the wrong values were produced in the first place
	• The process of finding bugs is called 'debugging'

Strict Mode
	• You can make JavaScript a little stricter? This is done by enabling 'strict' mode
		○ Putting the string 'use strict' at the top of a file or function body enables this
		Example:
		```
		function canYouSpotTheProblem() {
		  "use strict";
		  for (counter = 0; counter < 10; counter++) {
		    console.log("Happy happy");
		  }
		}
		
		canYouSpotTheProblem();
		// → ReferenceError: counter is not defined
		```
	• As can be seen, 'use strict' catches errors in bindings, not just when a binding is called
		○ For example, if you forget to say 'let' in a binding, a global binding is made by default
		○ 'use strict' prevents this and returns an error on compilation
		○ This doesn't work if a global binding for that value is already made though, so loops with this bug would not see this error returned
	• 'this' holds a value of 'undefined' in functions not called as methods when in strict mode
		○ Without strict mode, 'this' in functions that aren't methods use a global scope 'this' object
		○ Weird, never ran into that before
	Example:
	```
	function Person(name) { this.name = name; }
	let ferdinand = Person("Ferdinand"); // oops
	console.log(name);
	// → Ferdinand
	```
	That created a global variable 'name' with the value 'Ferdinand'.
	The function has no return value, so the name got made global.
	Now on strict mode:
	```
	"use strict";
	function Person(name) { this.name = name; }
	let ferdinand = Person("Ferdinand"); // forgot new
	// → TypeError: Cannot set property 'name' of undefined
	```
	• Constructors created with `class` throw an error if they are not called with 'new'
	• More strict mode:
		○ Functions cannot have multiple parameters of the same name
		○ `with` statement is removed
	• So in general, it's likely a good idea to include "use strict" in all JavaScript programs for debugging

Types
	• Types are inferred in JavaScript
		○ Mistakes arise when these 'inferences' are wrong for the program
	• Typing in a 'strongly typed' language looks like this:
	str A = "5";
	Instead of 
	let A = "5";
	Since in the JavaScipt, A could be used as both a string and a number.
	• TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript
		○ It's recommended to give more strict typing to programs
	• The book is not going to go into use of TypeScript, it's going to continue using JavaScript

Testing
	• Running the program is often times the way to see if it works
	• Running programs to find bugs is a tried and true way to test, but it's much faster to write test functions that do the test automatically
	• An example test is a simple function that verify if something exists or has the right value
	• There are software that run collections of tests in 'test suites', these are called 'test runners'
		○ The book doesn't mention any of these
	• Persistent objects in code make debugging easier than objects that change state, so following the paradigm of making persistent objects can alleviate bugs in the future

Debugging
	• Finding the actual source of the error can be an issue
		○ The compiler can tell where the error is encountered, but this is the first INSTANCE of the error being an issue, not the error coming up in the first place
		○ So where the compiler points to is not always the source of the bug
	• In general, think about why bugs come up first before changing code, not just changing code to see what works
	• console.log() is a tried and true way to see bugs
	• Browsers typically have a 'debugger' , which stops progams at a 'breakpoint', so you can see what values are at that instant
		○ This varies browser to browser though
	• Adding the line 'debugger' to a program will typically pause a program when it's run to that point

Error Propagation
	• When you release programs out to the real world, any number of issues tend to arrise
		○ The user is as much a variable as anything in the program
	• It is generally a good idea to write programs to assign values that DO work for when a user assigns a invalid value to a binding
		○ This lets the main program continue and not crash, that way you can tell the user they were wrong elegantly

Exceptions
	• Exception handling is when you can 'catch' an error and execute code in the case that an error is 'caught'
	• Exception handling is common in many programming languages, and they tend to the following for that: 'raise'/'throw', 'catch', 'try'
		○ I've seen this in python but not known how to use it yet
	• Exceptions make it possible to  'raise' or 'throw' an exeption, which can be any value
		○ Raising an exception breaks the function call stack and jumps to a 'try' block
		○ This is called 'unwinding the stack'
	• If a 'try' block has a 'catch' function to catch exceptions, the try block will execute when a exception is 'thrown'
	• If a try/catch block is run and does so without more errors, the program continues with all code below that block
	• The 'Error' constructor is a standard JavaScript constuctor that has a 'message' property
	Example:
	```
	function myfunc(args){
		stuff;
		if (condition){}
		else{
		throw new Error("you messed up");
		}
	try {
	console.log("I told you");
	} catch (error) {
		console.log(error)
	}
	```
	• A 'stack trace' is a log of where the error occured and which functions failed because of it
		○ This can be accessed by Error.stack
	• Exceptions let you run code with errors and show the errors in a nice way to the programmer and user, and they let code run even when the errors occur midway

Cleaning Up After Exceptions
	• Since exceptions are their own control flow, it's important to plan for cases where the exception happens and some blocks of regular code are not executed
	• Making functions that produce fewer side effects and not relying on those helps with cases of exceptions
		○ Similarly, making functions that produce new values instead of changing existing data helps
	• The 'finally' block executes regardless if whether a try block completely executes
		○ It runs when an exception is thrown in the 'try' block adn the stack continues
	• Anticipating and writing good exception handling is hard, but it's invaluable
		○ I notice how helpful it is when I call default functions and get exceptions, so I can debug my code
		○ It may be worth it to invest in practicing exception handling so I can give back to the developer community, especially when I make shareable code

Selective Catching
	• When exceptions are made without being caught, the behaviour differs between environments
		○ Browsers typically give a description of the error in the console
		○ Node.js aborts the whole process when any unhandeled exception occurs
			§ As annoying as this is, I like it?
			§ The book doesn't go into Node.js until chapter 20, but I've been learning how to use it on my own
			§ It does give exceptions very quickly, and I guess the browser isn't as quick to show the exeptions
	• When a 'catch' body is entered, it is known that something in the 'try' body caused an exception, but not necessarily what/which exception got raised
		○ This is because by default, 'catch' can catch any exception
		○ JavaScript doesn't have default 'selective catching', but you can write your own way to do it
	Side note: The `for (;;)` loop never terminates on its own, it only does when there is a break
	• A way to check if an exception is the one we expect, you can compare the exception.message property against what we expect
	Example:
	```
	class myError extends Error {}
	//This makes myError an instance of the Error constructor
	some_block{
		throw e;
	} catch (e) {
		if (e instanceof myError){
			do stuff;
		}
	}
	```

Assertions
	• Assertions check in a program that a value is what it's intended to be
	• The book doesn't mention an `assert` function, it talks about programming functions to throw exceptions when a value is not its intended value
		○ This does work as an 'assertion', but JavaScript seems to have added an assert method at some point:
			§ https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/met_assert.asp
			§ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/console/assert
	• Either way, assertions are good to use in tests, not so much in main programs

Summary
	• Finding and fixing bugs is a major part of programming
		○ Automated tests make this easier
	• Problems caused by things outside of the program should be handeled as much as possible with exceptions or special return values
	• Throwing exceptions unwinds the call stack until the next try/catch block, or the bottom of the stack
		○ Exception values are given to catch blocks, and those blocks should identify the exception and handle it
	• For unpredictable exceptions, the finally block always runs when the try/catch block finishes
