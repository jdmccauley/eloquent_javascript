//The purpose of this program is to prepare a string that looks like a chessboard:
/*
 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # #
*/
//and output the string to the console.
//After that, make a binding for a board size and allow a user to output any size board.
let size;
size = (prompt("Enter a size for a board: "));
console.log(size);
